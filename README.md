## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest packages installed

```
npm install
cd public
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, make sure you have
[node](http://nodejs.com) installed.

## Running the server

You can run your app using `npm start`. This will start a
server on `localhost:3000`.
